**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Description
I'm utilizing an AppStore developed by a budding start-up called Meta. As they're currently in the fundraising phase, they haven't yet implemented a feature to download invoices directly. This project is designed to assist you in obtaining invoices for the Meta Quest apps you've purchased.

## What?
Downloads invoices from Meta Quest orders.

## So...? Why do we need a script for this?

Downloads invoices from Meta Quest orders, something that Meta didn't think we needed.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
META_USERNAME=your-meta-username
META_PASSWORD=your-meta-password
```

4. Run `npm start`
